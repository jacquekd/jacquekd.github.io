		<p>
			Parlor is a dedicated safe space to learn how to care for our bodies and our minds. Parlor is more than just biological sex ed. Parlor is sexual education, physical health, emotional well-being, and one supportive community. 
			Parlor creates a safe place for women to share their stories and experiences, both positive and negative. This happens though a weekly dinner party where 14-18 year olds hold conversations with women’s health professionals in different fields, ranging in profession from gynecologists, therapists, doulas, nutritionists, health and wellness trainers, general doctors, nurses, physicians assistants, psychologists, relationship experts, etc.
			No offense, but no parents allowed. Parents are welcome to review the curriculum ahead of time, but we maintain conversation parlor as a dedicated space for young women to speak their minds openly without fear of disciplinary action.

		<h3>Why</h3>
		<p>
			Teens and young adults ages 14-24 in metropolitan Atlanta account formore than half of STD transmission even though they only account for one-fourth of the sexually active population. This is because in metro Atlanta, sexual health education is largely taught through abstinence-centered or science-based methods. These methods are incomplete educational tools because they are an incomplete health education. Health education is complete when it includes physical (including sexual) health and emotional health.
		</p>
		<h3>Where</h3>
		<p>
			Parlor takes place at civic centers in the neighborhood. These might be local government offices, churches, universities, local schools, and so on. We depend on neighborhoods for their support.
		</p>
		<h3>When</h3>
		<p>
			Parlor is a three month program. The dinner parties meet once a week during these three weeks, excepting holidays.

			<p>
				Stories are important because they can teach through experience. This is my story: When I first had sex, I didn’t want to. I was with my first boyfriend and I was pretty crazy about him. We had been drinking when he asked me if I wanted to have sex, and I said no, but he asked again and again and again. I repeatedly said no, but after a while, I was so tired of his begging that I changed my mind and said yes. I definitely didn’t want to at first, but I got really tired of him asking me, so at some point I decided that I just didn’t care and said “fine.” My answer did not mean that I wanted to have sex, it showed that I had stopped meant about my opinion and voice. Evidently, he didn’t care either!
				A couple months later, my younger sister called me from home while I was at college. She told me a story that sounded all too much like mine, and that made me feel bad. I told my sister my story after she told me hers, but I wonder if she could have had more guidance if I had told her my story sooner.
				Stories are why our Parlor exists: Our stories need to be passed on; our questions need to be answered; our feelings must be affirmed and our indifference investigated. 
				Parlor’s mission is to help each woman to discover her true self, and to be backed by a strong group of relentlessly supportive sisters along that journey.
